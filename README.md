## Current target for the game
The goal is to create a risk of rain-like game. Details have not yet been defined, but there will be a parry mechanic, and the game will be set in third person. So far we have created a map, got the character movement and camera working and have been working on billboarding as we plan to use 2D assets in a 3D environment for our characters. Our next target is implementing attacks and cleaning up the 2D billboarding for our sprites.
