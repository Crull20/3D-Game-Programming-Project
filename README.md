## PREY
In the game "PREY" you play as a lone rabbit escaping harsh woodland forests whilst fighting different predators along the way. The game loop starts with the player in an area and finding a shrine. When the shrine is activated, a time limit will start; this is the amount of time the player has until they are able to escape into the next area. During this time limit the player will be bombarded with various *difficult* enemies. The player must survive in this time frame whilst also collecting loot for upgrades in order to help defeat enemies in future areas. As the player progresses through each map the enemies get increasingly more difficult so it is imperative to the player that they make the most of their time in each area.

## Current target for the game
The goal is to create a risk of rain-like game. Details have not yet been defined, but there will be a parry mechanic, and the game will be set in third person. So far we have created a map, got the character movement and camera working and have been working on billboarding as we plan to use 2D assets in a 3D environment for our characters. Our next target is implementing attacks and cleaning up the 2D billboarding for our sprites.

## General Goals for each person

## Link to Video
The first video shows our progress so far with creating a playable character in a 3D environment and having camera physics that follow the player. 
The second video is the progress of our map and environment including foliage like trees.
